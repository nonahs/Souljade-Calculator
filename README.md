# Souljade Calculator

Old calculator I made for the Perfect World game Battle of the Immortals, updated with some bootstrap components. The game came out back in 2010 and the official servers shutdown in 2018 but many private servers still operate.

A Odin's Soul jade is a powerful item that has a dedicated equipment slot for each character. Aura's of Souljade can drop from any enemy over level 30 and 3 combine into a level 1 Odin's Soul jade. It takes 3 of the current level souljade and an upgrade fee to upgrade to the next level. This calculator allows players to work out how much it will cost to upgrade their current souljade to the desired level based on the current cost of aura of souljades. Auras are commonly sold for 3000 coins but can vary if buying in bulk or on private servers.
